# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Project

Pewlett Hackard is a large company boasting several thousand employees, and it's been around for a long time. As baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate, Pewlett Hackard is looking toward the future in two ways. First, it's offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria. Second, it's starting to think about which positions will need to be filled in the near future.

The number of upcoming retirements will leave thousands of job openings. 

In order for Pewlett Hackard to future-proof itself, it is necessary to know who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill.


## Results

It is considered that employees close to retirement are the ones who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 

The analysis performed on Pewlett Hackard's employees to future-proof itself relied on two different searches:
1. The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
2. The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program


### The Number of Retiring Employees by Title

- There are 72,458 employees that match the criteria of birth date (between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955)
- 70.2% of them occupy senior positions (Enginners & Staff)
- Only 2 managers are expected to retire soon

### The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

Mentorship Program eligibility is defined for employees who were born in 1965.

- 1,549 employees meet the Mentorship Program eligibility criteria (2.1% of all employees close to retirement).


## Summary

There are 72,458 employees close to retirement; yet, only 1,549 are eligible for the Mentorship Program.
A deeper analysis shows that the Mentorship Program is not well-balanced, as there are no managers eligible for the Mentorship Program:

However, after analyzing the number of employees close to retirement by department and the Mentoring Program, turns out that there is a well-balanced among the various departments, as the percentage of mentors for employees close to retirement is very similar.

In the end, it seems that the Mentoring Program should expand the timeframe elegibility, in order to have more mentors at the manager and senior engineer titles.
